<p>My name is Beck Locey and I'm the oldest of seven children. My parents are still living and they're at that point in life where we're starting to think about estate planning. So between my parents and myself and some of my siblings, we have real estate from the east coast to the west coast.</p>

<p>My major challenges are keeping track of all the information associated with the various properties and deals that we have all across America. So it's very difficult to remember who the attorney was and put the transaction together.</p>

<p>Who is the escrow officer in case I need certain documentation? Which CPA did my dad use for that particular deal? Those are the sorts of things that are very difficult for me to track down. When you have a lot of holdings, you just don't remember all the time.</p>

<p>You think you will remember, but the fact is you don't. My dad has some information, my brother has some information, my sister has some information, and we don't have all the information in the central location.</p>

<p>So for me, being able to manage everything in Main Street has been a game changer. I can keep track of the property managers for the various properties, the taxing authorities, the escrow agent, or literally anything else I need to keep track of for all the various properties that we maintain.</p>

<p>As you use Main Street Pulse, what you can do is you can organize all your properties. You can visualize them so you can see which entities are that you're using to own your properties. You can also share the information very easily, for example, with siblings or trustees or bankers or other individuals that have a need to know, and it's a great way to visualize it.</p>

<p>Main Street Pulse does an excellent job of providing a summary of all of our holdings in one screen.</p>
