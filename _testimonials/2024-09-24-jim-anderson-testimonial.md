<p>Hi, my name is Jim Anderson, and I love using Main Street Pulse.</p>
<p>For a while now, I've really been looking for a product that allowed me to take my properties that I own with some business partners of mine and load them up into a platform where I could really easily see all of them in one place.</p>
<p>So not only that, but but see the businesses and the way that they're structured from a legal standpoint.</p>
<p>Coming into the platform was so easy I asked me the information, I loaded up my information about the properties and you know now you can just quickly and easily see where these properties stand.</p>
<p>The property values the equity that you have in them as well as the organizational structure.</p>
<p>One of the things I really love is the visualization that Main Street pulls offers me.</p>
<p>I love to go into a meeting with my partners, pull Main Street Pulse up on the board and you can quickly and easily see your entire portfolio, drill into a certain property and talk about the strategy around that.</p>
<p>But also come back and just kind of see your entire portfolio.</p>
<p>So, really love the visualization feature that that offers me.</p>
<p>I'm really excited for the additional features that are coming and I'm very happy as a Main Street Pulse user and excited for what's coming in the future.</p>
