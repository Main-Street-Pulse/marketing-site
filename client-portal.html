        <h2>Organize and track clients assets and entities</h2>
        
        <p>One of the biggest challenges is tracking all your clients' assets, properties, and entities. Main Street Pulse allows you to easily organize and track these assets in a way that gives you a clear picture of their wealth structure. With a powerful dashboard, you'll have a visual representation of how everything ties together. Each business entity, investment property, and asset is mapped out so you can see how the income flows—ordinary or passive—and how it fits into the broader wealth strategy.</p>
        
        <p>For accountants and tax attorneys, this tool allows you to focus on providing value. Instead of hunting for documents and trying to manually map out how entities are connected, Main Street Pulse gives you a clear, organized view of your client's entire portfolio. It's the perfect tool to ensure you're on top of the details.</p>
