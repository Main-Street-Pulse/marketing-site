<p>Main Street Pulse offers guidance, information organization, and time-sensitive tracking for real estate investors and business owners, allowing them to focus on building wealth. The process involves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting up real estate properties.</li>
  <li>Adding any business entities.</li>
  <li>Linking the two together to establish a clear plan and structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps with tax planning and asset protection.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">First</span>, input all your real estate properties, including your primary residence and investment properties. <a href="/support/set-up-your-real-estate-properties/">Find out more about setting up real estate.</a></p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Second</span>, set up your business entities. These could be a sole proprietorship, holding company, active business, or a trust. With Main Street Pulse, you can classify a business as generating active or passive income. <a href="/support/set-up-your-business-entities/">Find out more about how to establish business entities.</a></p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Third</span>, connect your real estate with your business entities. If you have an LLC that owns real estate, you can link them together. Similarly, if you have a holding company that owns other businesses, you can link them together. This approach works well if you have a trust that owns everything.</p>
