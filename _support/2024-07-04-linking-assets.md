<h2>Linking assets</h2>
<p>Main Street Pulse's goal is to give you an overview of your portfolio and help you see how everything works together as you plan and manage your wealth. Adding assets will give you a better idea of how everything is structured.</p>

<p>Go into the business entity you want to manage and click on the Assets tab. Click on <strong>"Add assets,"</strong> and this will give you the option to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new asset</li>
  <li>Link an existing real estate asset</li>
  <li>Link an existing business entity</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>When you select to link an existing real estate or business entity asset, you will see a dropdown with your current assets listed. If you create a new asset, you can define its type and provide more information about it. There are many options of assets to add, but some of the most popular are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bank accounts</li>
  <li>Brokerage accounts</li>
  <li>401k accounts</li>
  <li>Cryptocurrencies</li>
  <li>IRAs</li>
</ul>
