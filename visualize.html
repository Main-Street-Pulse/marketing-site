        <h2>Organize and Visualize Your Wealth</h2>

        <h3>Real Estate Organization</h3>  
        <p>Imagine a tree where each branch represents a different part of your investment portfolio. The Wealth Visualization feature lets you see all your real estate holdings in one place. From residential properties to commercial investments, everything is organized in a visual chart that’s easy to understand. This helps you keep track of your properties and see how they contribute to your overall wealth.</p>

        <h3>Real Estate Tracking</h3>  
        <p>Keeping track of multiple properties can be overwhelming. Our tool gives you a clear visual representation of each property’s status, upcoming deadlines, and important documents—no more missing critical dates or losing track of essential information. Everything you need is at your fingertips, helping you stay on top of your investments effortlessly.</p>

        <h2>Manage Your Business Entities</h2>

        <h3>Business Entity Organization</h3>  
        <p>Your investment journey often involves multiple business entities. Whether it’s an LLC for a rental property or a corporation for a commercial building, keeping everything organized is crucial. Our Wealth Visualization tool helps you see how each business entity fits into your overall financial picture. This organized approach ensures you can manage each entity effectively and see how they work together to build wealth.</p>

        <h2>Tracking Your Wealth</h2>

        <p>Our Wealth Visualization feature offers a bottom-up view of your financial structure. This means you start by seeing yourself at the bottom and your wealth tree growing upwards. Each branch and leaf represent different businesses, properties, and assets. This visual approach makes it easy to see how everything connects and contributes to your wealth.</p>

        <p>Seeing how your assets grow and link together is motivating and essential for effective management. The Wealth Visualization tool shows how all your ordinary and passive income flows down to your main level. Ideally, this main level is a revocable trust or yourself, ensuring all your wealth is centrally managed and easily accessible.</p>
